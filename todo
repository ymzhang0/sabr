i notice that you've put the bridge_service:AiiDABridgeService inside sab_core which is a bit unsettling.
sab_core defined the framework of this kind of agent and aiida is one of the implementation.
would it be better if the code related to aiida is separated from the core and be be put inside engines/
or another specifically created new folder if necessary? done

now since frontend is in the top dir. why not move also the backend to the top level and put the 
aiida-related code inside it. done

since aiida_bridge is moved into ../aiida_worker why not remove it from this package.

please make sure to exclude those temporary files that are generated when creating the webpage and are not important.

find a cleaner way to organize the structure of this package

clean unused code

optimize the log

for the construction of the workchainnode, we should prefer get_builder_from_protocol than filling in the inputs item by item since in each workchain there are valuable logic defined in this class function. if we use plain get_builder or even worse we fill in the ports by ourself, we might miss a lot of detail or even the process will crash.
