# Legacy AiiDA UI/API Artifacts

This folder stores archived FastUI code paths that are no longer part of the active runtime.

Active API/runtime modules are under `src/sab_engines/aiida/` (for example `router.py`, `chat/`, `client.py`, `service.py`, `agent/tools.py`).

Nothing in this folder is mounted by `app_api.py`.
